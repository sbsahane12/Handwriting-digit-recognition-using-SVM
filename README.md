# [Project  7: Handwriting digit recognition using SVM](https://github.com/sbsahane12/Handwriting-digit-recognition-using-SVM.git) 
## Problem Statement
As people have different handwriting it is difficult for a computer or any device to understand those handwritings of different people. The handwriting recognition is the ability of a computer or a device to take input handwriting in the form of an image such as picture of handwritten text which is fed to the pattern recognition algorithm or a model
## Steps :
- Data Inspection â€“ Missing Values if any, EDA
- Outlier Analysis
- Data Pre-processing
- Finding Optimal number of Clusters
- Modelling
## Install
This project requires Python 3.6 and the following libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
## Conclusion : 
- Therefore as we can see in this scenario the non Linear model provides a higher accuracy than the Linear model which are **94%** and **91%** respectively.  
- Therefore we can conclude that the problem is non linear in nature.
